Your task for today is to implement an application to run our new restaurant. Your application should provide the following functionality:
1. Take an order from table with customers
   - Table can have 1 customer or more.
   - Customer can choose one or more dishes from the menu.
   - Each dish can have different price and preparation-time.
   - Table order includes orders from all customers.
3. Send the order to the kitchen by a waiter
4. In the kitchen a chef is working on the order
   - The chef can work only on one order at a time.
6. Once the order is ready, the order should be delivered to the table
   - Order preparation time calculated by the preparation-time of dish with the longest preparation-time included in the order.
   -  When the order is ready one of the waiters should be notified and serve the dishes to the table.
8. After the waiter serve the dishes, heâ€™s also giving the bill to the table
9. Add an option to add more chefs to the restaurant (although currently they have a budget only for one).
   
More Chefs can work on DIFFERENT orders in the same time and reduce waiting time to the customers.

Provide a design of your solution and the architecture of the program.

Show which entities participate in your solution and describe the flow of the solution.
